  - 'So, I need your help to collect these 5 items to build a vaccine for this! '
  - This vaccine will make us immune to the infection. So then we can leave this city!
  - These 5 items are the 5 kind of chocolate candies the Zonka Company produced.
  - Can you help me? Please. The future of Zonka City is on your hands.
